some cool thing chatgpt told me about lol
<br>
<br>
basically in naturally occurring datasets, it is more likely for the beginning digit of a number to be smaller (1) than bigger (9) or something like that lol don't ask me
<br>
<br>
anyways i <strike>chatgpt'd</strike> totally legitimately wrote all of this code myself!!!! :D
