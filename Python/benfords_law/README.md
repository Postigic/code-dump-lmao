## 💡 overview

funny `matplotlib` graph that uses a real dataset to show benford's law in action!!!  
what is benford's law? basically, in naturally occurring datasets, it is more likely for the beginning digit of a number to be smaller (1) than bigger (9) or something like that lol don't ask me  
anyways i ~~chatgpt'd~~ totally legitimately wrote all of this code myself!!!! :D
