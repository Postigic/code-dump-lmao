# core game

this is my favourite project and yet it makes me want to give up
</br>
</br>
i might revert it back to some fusion concept if i can't get the quantum one right (well, perhaps i'll keep it on the back burner)
</br>
</br>
sometimes i feel like scrapping this, but as they all say.... no fear....!!!
